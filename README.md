# RecoDroneTest [WIP]
Record Drone Test is a simple project to automatically record test video of drone.

## Motivation

Video review for drone test is a real advantages and can lead to faster improvement and reporting.
However it also require some attention, focus and time. The proposed solution aims to automate the acquisition process by starting recording image based on sound.
Indeed, a drone armed is really noisy and we can use these sound to trigger the recording.

Such system can:
- Automate the test recording.
- Help development by having video analyse data.
- Provide additionnal material for report and project communication.
- Learning more about AI on Edge and sound processing.
